Weld is the reference implementation of CDI: Contexts and Dependency Injection for the Java EE Platform which is the Java standard for dependency injection and contextual lifecycle management and one of the most important and popular parts of the Java EE platform.

Weld is integrated into many Java EE application servers such as WildFly, JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, GlassFish, Oracle WebLogic and others. Weld can also be used in a Servlet-only environment (Tomcat, Jetty) or plain Java SE environment.

See http://weld.cdi-spec.org for more details.

Building Weld
-------------

To build Weld simply run

> $ mvn clean install

Upgrading Weld in WildFly
-------------------------

Firstly, set the `JBOSS_HOME` environment property to point to your WildFly installation which already contains Weld 3 in older version:

> $ export JBOSS_HOME=/opt/wildfly

Then, run the upgrade script:

> $ mvn package -Pupdate-jboss-as -f jboss-as/pom.xml -Dweld.update.version=${weld.version}

In the above snippet, `${weld.version}` is the version of Weld you want to use.
Now you should have patched WildFly in `JBOSS_HOME`.

Creating a patch file for WildFly
---------------------------------

Apart from just patching a WildFly, there is a semi-automated way to create reusable patch-file too.
To do that, three things are needed:
* Clean WildFly
  * A basis which you want the patch for
  * If you use following profile, WildFly 10.1.0.Final will be automatically donwloaded `-Pdownload-wfly`
  * If you already have one, or wish to use a different version, set the path to it throught property `-DwildflyOriginal=/path/to/clean/wfly`
* Patched WildFly with Weld 3 version you want
  * Needs to prepared in advance and placed in `-DwildflyPatched=/path/to/patched/wfly`
  * `-Pupdate-jboss-as` can be used to create patched WildFly, see the paragraph above
* Patch XML descriptor
  * By default, this is automatically grabbed from our [repository](https://github.com/weld/build/tree/master/wildfly) for WildFly 10.1.0.Final
  * You can set different version via `-Dpatch.file.name="patch-config-wildfly-10-weld-3.0.xml"`

So, here are the commands:
* `export JBOSS_HOME=/path/to/wfly; mvn clean install -Pupdate-jboss-as,download-wfly,wfly-patch-gen -f jboss-as/pom.xml`
  * In your target folder you get pristine WildFly, patch file (XML) and a complete patch.zip
  * Your `JBOSS_HOME` will be patched
* `export JBOSS_HOME=/path/to/wfly; mvn clean install -Pupdate-jboss-as,download-wfly -f jboss-as/pom.xml`
  * You will end up with pristine WildFly in your target folder
  * Your `JBOSS_HOME` will be patched
  * No patch will be generated
* `export JBOSS_HOME=/path/to/wfly; mvn clean install -Pwfly-patch-gen -DwildflyOriginal=/opt/myCleanWfly11 -DwildflyPatched=/opt/myPatchedWfly11 -Dpatch.file.name=patch-config-wildfly-11-weld-3.0.xml -f jboss-as/pom.xml`
  * This is a manual way where all variables are specified, here we patch Wildfly 11 to latest Weld 3
  * Need to specify both WildFly instances - clean one and already patched one
  * Also need to give provide specific patch XML descriptor as the default one targets WildFly 10, but we need 11 - hence `patch-config-wildfly-11-weld-3.0.xml`

Running integration tests and the TCK on WildFly
----------------------------------------------------

Follow the steps above to set the JBOSS_HOME environment property and to upgrade Weld
within WildFly. Then, run:

> $ mvn clean verify -Dincontainer -f tests-arquillian/pom.xml

> $ mvn clean verify -Dincontainer -f jboss-tck-runner/pom.xml

If you want to run a specific test you can use the `-Dtest=<test_name>` flag. For example 

> $ mvn clean verify -Dincontainer -f jboss-tck-runner/pom.xml -Dtest=FireEventTest

Will run all the tests defined in `FireEventTest`.

> $ mvn clean verify -Dincontainer -f jboss-tck-runner/pom.xml -Dtest=FireEventTest#testInjectedEventAcceptsEventObject

Will only run the `FireEventTest.testInjectedEventAcceptsEventObject()` test method.
